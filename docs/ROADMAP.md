## Overview

Astra is developed in seven phases, each building on the previous.  The goal of each phase is a **runnable, testable artifact** — not just design work.

---

## Phase 1 — Local Heterogeneous Single-Node (COMPLETE ✓)

**Goal:** Prove the CPU/GPU split works end-to-end on a single machine.

| Task | Status | Module |
|------|--------|--------|
| TensorPacket wire format (serialize / deserialize) | ✓ Done | `astra/serialization/tensor_pack.py` |
| Binary round-trip test (pack → unpack → verify) | ✓ Done | `mock_pipeline.py` Phase 1 Step A |
| SharedExpertCache with pinned shared experts 0 & 1 | ✓ Done | `astra/inference/shared_expert_cache.py` |
| HeterogeneousEngine: attention stub + MoE CPU path | ✓ Done | `astra/inference/heterogeneous.py` |
| KTransformersStub (numpy fallback for dev/CI) | ✓ Done | `astra/inference/heterogeneous.py` |
| GeoAwareMoERouter: haversine RTT + gate + dispatch | ✓ Done | `astra/routing/geo_router.py` |
| mock_pipeline.py Phase 1 runner | ✓ Done | `mock_pipeline.py` |
| Environment checker (`scripts/check_env.py`) | ✓ Done | `scripts/check_env.py` |
| Apache 2.0 compliance (headers, NOTICE, LICENSE) | ✓ Done | root + all source files |

**Milestone test:**
```bash
python mock_pipeline.py --phase 1 --seq-len 16 --hidden-dim 256
# Expected: "Phase 1 COMPLETE ✓"
```

---

## Phase 2 — Dual-Node LAN Pipeline (COMPLETE ✓)

**Goal:** Two nodes on localhost exchange TensorPackets over gRPC, completing the "pack → transmit → compute → receive" loop.

| Task | Status | Module |
|------|--------|--------|
| `inference.proto` gRPC service definition | ✓ Done | `astra/rpc/proto/inference.proto` |
| Compiled pb2 Python stubs | ✓ Done | `astra/rpc/generated/` |
| InferenceServer (gRPC servicer + lifecycle) | ✓ Done | `astra/rpc/server.py` |

| CRC32 integrity check on wire | ✓ Done | `astra/rpc/client.py` |
| Ping / capability advertisement | ✓ Done | `InferenceServer._servicer.Ping` |
| mock_pipeline.py Phase 2 runner (2 threaded servers) | ✓ Done | `mock_pipeline.py` |

**Milestone test:**
```bash
python mock_pipeline.py --phase 2 --seq-len 16 --hidden-dim 256
# Expected: "Phase 2 COMPLETE ✓" with RTT numbers for both nodes
```

---

## Phase 3 — Full P2P Network (SOFTWARE-COMPLETE ✓)

**Goal:** Real multi-machine cluster with hivemind DHT discovery, peer
authentication, weight integrity, and storage/compute role separation.

> **Scope split (April 2026):** The original Phase 3 plan bundled performance
> optimizations (continuous batching, speculative decoding, expert
> replication, adaptive load balancing) with the P2P infrastructure. Those
> optimizations cannot be validated without real model weights and a GPU
> cluster, so they have been moved to **[Phase 7 — Inference Performance
> Tuning](#phase-7--inference-performance-tuning-blocked-on-hardware)** and
> tagged as hardware-blocked. The P2P infrastructure portion is now complete.

## Phase 5 — gRPC TLS + hivemind Multi-Machine DHT (SOFTWARE-COMPLETE ✓)

**Goal:** Secure all inter-node communication with mutual TLS and integrate live hivemind DHT for real multi-machine discovery.

> **Scope note (April 2026):** All code deliverables — TLS certificate generation,
> mTLS server/client integration, TOFU trust store, hivemind DHT bridge, and the
> `create_dht()` factory with graceful degradation — are complete and tested
> (389 passed, 1 skipped). Multi-machine bootstrap validation (multiple physical
> nodes) is a deployment verification step, not a software gap. See

> procedure.

## Phase 7 — Inference Performance Tuning (BLOCKED ON HARDWARE)

**Goal:** Performance optimizations that require real model weights, real
GPU hardware, and real production workloads to design and validate.

> **Why blocked:** Each hardware-dependent item below makes a quantitative
> trade-off (latency vs throughput, memory vs replication overhead,
> draft-model accuracy vs speedup). Without real measurements these
> decisions devolve into guesswork. The infrastructure they plug into
> (HeterogeneousEngine, GeoAwareMoERouter, KVCacheSender) is already in
> place; what's missing is the data to drive the design.

## Known Limitations (Alpha)

1. **No real model weights** — all tensors are random. The infrastructure
   (loader, manifest verification, tokenizer, gRPC, DHT) is ready to accept
   real weights, but Phase 7 work (real KTransformers + GPU validation)
   remains.
2. **KTransformersStub is numpy** — ~100× slower than C++ CUDA kernels.
   Use for correctness testing only.
3. **DHT bridge ready, multi-machine validation pending** — The hivemind DHT
   bridge (`astra/network/hivemind_bridge.py`) is fully implemented and tested.
   Multi-machine bootstrap and cross-machine discovery require multiple physical
   nodes for validation; see `docs/HIVEMIND.md` §8 Production Checklist.
4. **TLS available but not enforced by default** — `astra/rpc/tls.py` ships
   the certificate machinery; production deployments must opt in. See
   `docs/TLS.md`.
5. **No hardware CI** — GPU integration tests require a self-hosted runner.
   See [docs/TESTING.md](TESTING.md) for the pending hardware test plan.
